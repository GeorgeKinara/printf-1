## **Tasks**
<br>
0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life
<br>
* Write a function that produces output according to a format.
 * c : converts input into a character
 * s : converts input into a string
<br>
1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't
* Handle the following conversion specifiers:
 * d : converts input into a base 10 integer
 * i : converts input into an integer
